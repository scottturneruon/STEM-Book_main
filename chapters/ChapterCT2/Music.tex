\section{Sonic Pi}


The goal - spooky/moanful Hot-Cross Buns (the only bit of music I know the notes for), just so I can play a bit. So let us start with resources I have found useful, alongside Sonic Pi (https://sonic-pi.net/; a really useful webpage is \url{https://newt.phys.unsw.edu.au/jw/notes.html}  to turn the notes into the MIDI number (60, etc) 

So by the end of the last post I got to adding a techno effect on top of the tune:
\begin{lstlisting}
use_synth :prophet
with_fx :ixi_techno do
  2.times do
    play chord(:b4, :minor7)
    sleep 0.5
    play chord(:a4, :minor7)
    sleep 0.5
    play chord(:g4, :minor7)
    sleep 0.5
  end
  4.times do
    play chord(:g4, :minor7)
    sleep 0.25
  end
  4.times do
    play chord(:a4, :minor7)
    sleep 0.25
  end
  play chord(:b4, :minor7)
  sleep 0.5
  play chord(:a4, :minor7)
  sleep 0.5
  play chord(:g4, :minor7)
  sleep 0.5
end
\end{lstlisting}


Sonic Pi is a cool system I found out you get it to pan the sounds from left to right and played with that but didn't include it in the end. What I did change in was a different synth but also samples, after trail-and-error, chose the ambi_dark_whoosh (had to with that name)
\begin{lstlisting}
use_synth :tech_saws
sample :ambi_dark_woosh, amp: 0.25
with_fx :ixi_techno do
  2.times do
    play chord(:b3, :minor7)
    sleep 0.5
    play chord(:a3, :minor7)
    sleep 0.5
    play chord(:g3, :minor7)
    sleep 0.5
  end
  sample :ambi_dark_woosh, amp: 0.25
  4.times do
    play chord(:g3, :minor7)
    sleep 0.25
  end
  4.times do
    play chord(:a3, :minor7)
    sleep 0.25
  end
  sample :ambi_dark_woosh, amp: 0.25
  play chord(:b3, :minor7)
  sleep 0.5
  play chord(:a3, :minor7)
  sleep 0.5
  play chord(:g3, :minor7)
  sleep 0.5
end
\end{lstlisting}



This is a bit of software (and support on Patreon) it is just fun and free. I have no musical ability but I enjoy creating with it.
