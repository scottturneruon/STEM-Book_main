\chapter{Microbit V1 data logging}
\section{Why?}
Often we need applications that allow collection of data over time, for example temperature or light levels through the day. Allowing us potentially analyse the data for trends. The microbit is a fantastic tool with some of these sensors already in place (e.g. light and temperature) or can be added to with extra sensors from add-on boards (such as Kitronik Air Quality and Environmental Board for micro:bit https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/kitronik-air-quality-and-environmental-board-for-micro-bit?variant=39475687227475 )

Datalogging with a V2 microbit is relatively easy all the details are available here: https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/data-logging/ to get started. 

But what about the older V1 can it do it?

The answer is yes but it is a little more work and is generally a little more limited but still very worth while. In this article we are going to look at doing this.
